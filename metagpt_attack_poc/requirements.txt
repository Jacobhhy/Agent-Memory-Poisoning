# MetaGPT Memory Poisoning Attack - Requirements

# Core MetaGPT (already installed as parent dependency)
# This POC expects MetaGPT to be installed in parent directory

# No additional dependencies required beyond MetaGPT's own requirements
# All attack code uses only Python standard library and MetaGPT imports

# For reference, main MetaGPT dependencies used:
# - pydantic (for data models)
# - asyncio (for async operations)
# - json (standard library, for data handling)

# Optional: For enhanced analysis
# pandas>=1.5.0  # For data analysis
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For visualization
# numpy>=1.21.0  # For numerical operations

# Development tools (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0  # For testing
# black>=22.0.0  # For code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0  # For linting
